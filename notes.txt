React 
It is a Javascript library for building user interfaces.

The user interface(UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device. This can include display screens,
keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop.

Component Based Approach:
A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other wrds, we can say that every application you will develop in React
will be made up of pieces called components.
Components make the task of building UIs much easier.

Declarative Approach:
Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that express the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

DOM updates are handled gracefully
Reusable Code
React is designed for speed of implementing the application simplicity and scalability.

node_module:
node_modules folder is the repository of modules/library which you are using inside your project. What ever you are importing in your
project that module or library should present inside the node_module folder.When you do npm install that time that module or the library
install inside the node_module folder and one entry added in package.json file.

The html tags used under render in js is called JSX.
